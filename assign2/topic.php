                As we all know, computer as a machine, has been around for centuries. Depending on the time period, it may had been utilitze differently than others. The computer evolve, becoming more powerful and continously advancing as time passes. In this report, we will take a look at the evolution of computing through various generations:

                        The history of modern computing rooted back to the 1801s, when the first automatically weave fabric designs was invented. The French man inventor, Joseph Marie Jacquard, created an automatic fabric weaving loom using punched wooden cards. The mechanism of the invention can also be seen in today’s computer. Twenty-years late, A machine that could compute tables of numbers was invented by Charles Babbage and his son Henry.  It eventually named the Babbage’s Analytical Engine. Programmed using punch cards, the machine featured ALU, integrated memory and basic flow control.

                        The first ever program was written by an English mathematician, Ada Lovelace. She became the first ever program by unintentionally create algorithm by computing Bernoulli number with Babbage machine. In 1853, a father and son of Per George Scheutz and Edvard, invent a machine which print out result of a calculation. The to-be founder of IBM, Herman Hollerith, invented a punch-card system that changes the way people do taxes. The punch-card system record data by letting the user punches holes in specific location of the paper.

                        In 1931, Vannevar Bush and his teammates at MIT invented the Differential Analyzer, which is a device to calculate and solve problems relating to calculus, derivatives, practically. It is accounted the first analog computer. However, it is still mechanical. Five years later, Alan Turing, a scientist and mathematician has invented and published a new computing model from which computers nowadays used the concept. It is called Turing machine – an unlimited tape with a head to execute and record some of the basic actions at that moment, e.g., writing, reading, acknowledging the state, Turing was then become well-known and he has been invited to a project that can help solving the Nazi code in World War II.

                        In 1938, there was a contract signed by Walt Disney to apply an audio oscillator called 200A into their movie showings. The contract was offered initially by David Packard and Bill Hewlett – two Stanford University graduates. The idea of the oscillator was utilizing the normal light bulb as a resistor, which made an explosive deduction in the price in comparison with market price (about 54$ of HP company compared to 200$ of market price). Hence, Bill and David constantly develop and generate more technical projects and it was a break-through regarding computing sector. From 1940 on, there appeared lots of inventions and improving from science world. In 1941, German inventor Konrad Zuse established a new model of computer called Z3, which is believed the first digital computer. After World War 2, Konrad Zuse left the capital city of Germany as they was the loser and started to recreate his old project and presented it once again under a new name – Z4, the first commercial digital computer. Later on, there was lots of old model computers been released especially like:

                        In 1953 the first computer language was developed known as Common Business Oriented Language by Grace Hopper as it’s largely credited for helping to build the computer software industry and nowadays it’s replaced by java. Though, the first High level Programming language (FORTRAN) was created in 1954 by Jhon Backus, helped open the door to modern technology as its widely used by scientist for different project e.g., aero plane structure.
